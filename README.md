# Data Analytics Project for Watch Price Prediction

This project focuses on predicting watch prices, classifying watches based on their prices, and performing clustering to identify similar groups of watches. Standard machine learning algorithms are used for this purpose using techniques such as Cross Validation and Data Augmentation.

## Project Description
The main objective of this project is to apply machine learning techniques to solve three key tasks related to watches:

1. **Watch Price Prediction:** Using historical data and watch features, predictive models are trained to estimate watch prices.
2. **Watch Classification:** Classifying watches into different categories based on their prices.
3. **Watch Clustering:** Grouping similar watches using unsupervised clustering techniques.
